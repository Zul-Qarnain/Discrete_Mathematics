## Reflexive Relation

**Definition:** A relation 'R' on a set 'A' is said to be **Reflexive** if (x, x) ∈ R ∀ x ∈ A.

> (x, x) ∈ R ∀ x ∈ A.{x,x belongs to R for every for every x belongs to A}

* This means that every element in the set 'A' must be related to itself in the relation 'R' for 'R' to be considered reflexive.

**Example:**

Let A = {1, 2, 3}

A x A = { (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) 
           (2,1) (2,2) (2,3)
           (3,1) (3,2) (3,3)}

Let's analyse some relations on A:

* **R<sub>1</sub>** = { (1,1) (2,2) (3,3) }

   * R<sub>1</sub> **is reflexive** because it contains all pairs (x, x) for every x in A. 

* **R<sub>2</sub>** = { (1,1) (2,2) }

   * R<sub>2</sub> **is not reflexive** because it's missing (3,3).

* **R<sub>3</sub>** = { (1,1) (2,2) (3,3) (1,2) }

   * R<sub>3</sub> **is reflexive** even though it contains an extra element (1,2).  The presence of all (x,x) pairs is what matters.

**Further Examples:**

* **R<sub>1</sub> = {(x,y) | x - y is an integer}** 

    * This relation is reflexive because for any integer x,  x-x = 0, which is an integer.

* **R<sub>2</sub> = {(x,y) | x - y is an odd number}**

    * This relation is **not** reflexive.  For any integer x, x - x = 0, and 0 is not an odd number. 

**Checking for Reflexivity:**

To determine if a relation on a set is reflexive, check if every element of the set forms a pair with itself within the relation.  If even one such pair is missing, the relation is not reflexive.
