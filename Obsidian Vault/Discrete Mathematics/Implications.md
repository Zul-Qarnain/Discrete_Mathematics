#implications

**Implications:** 
An **implication** or **conditional** is a molecular statement of the form
P→Q
where P and Q are statements. We say that
• P is the **hypothesis** (or **antecedent**).
• Q is the **conclusion** (or **consequent**).
An implication is true provided P is false or Q is true (or both),
and false otherwise. In particular, the only way for P → Q to be false
is for P to be true and Q to be false.(Page.no-7)

> [!example]
> ==Example 0.2.2==
> **Consider the statement:**
> **If Bob gets a 90 on the final, then Bob will pass the class.**
> **This is definitely an implication: P is the statement “Bob gets a 90**
> **on the final,” and Q is the statement “Bob will pass the class.”**
> **Suppose I made that statement to Bob. In what circumstances**
> **would it be fair to call me a liar? What if Bob really did get a 90**
> **on the final, and he did pass the class? Then I have not lied; my**
> **statement is true. However, if Bob did get a 90 on the final and**
> **did not pass the class, then I lied, making the statement false. The**
> **tricky case is this: what if Bob did not get a 90 on the final? Maybe**
> **he passes the class, maybe he doesn’t. Did I lie in either case? I**
> **think not. In these last two cases, P was false, and the statement**
> **P → Q was true. In the first case, Q was true, and so was P → Q.**
> **So P → Q is true when either P is false or Q is true.**


> [!question]
> Example 0.2.3
> Decide which of the following statements are true and which are
> false. Briefly explain.
> 1. If 1 = 1, then most horses have 4 legs.
> 2. If 0 = 1, then 1 = 1.
> 3. If 8 is a prime number, then the 7624th digit of π is an 8.
> 4. If the 7624th digit of π is an 8, then 2 + 2 = 4.

> [!hint]
> Solution. 
> All four of the statements are true. Remember, the only
> way for an implication to be false is for the if part to be true and the
> then part to be false.
> 1. Here both the hypothesis and the conclusion are true, so
> the implication is true. It does not matter that there is no
> meaningful connection between the true mathematical fact
> and the fact about horses.
> 2. Here the hypothesis is false and the conclusion is true, so the
> implication is true.
> 3. I have no idea what the 7624th digit of π is, but this does
> not matter. Since the hypothesis is false, the implication is
> automatically true.
> 4. Similarly here, regardless of the truth value of the hypothesis,
> the conclusion is true, making the implication true.
