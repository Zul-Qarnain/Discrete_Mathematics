## How many Reflexive Relations?

**Understanding the Basics**

* **Reflexive Relation:** A relation on a set A is reflexive if every element of A is related to itself.
* **Cartesian Product (AxA):** Represents all possible ordered pairs that can be formed from a set.
* **Finding Reflexive Relations:**  Focus on elements along the "diagonal" of the AxA matrix (where the first and second elements of the ordered pair are the same). 

**Examples**

1. **A = {1, 2}**

   * AxA = {(1,1), (1,2), (2,1), (2,2)}
   * Diagonal Elements: (1,1), (2,2)
   * Possible Reflexive Relations:
      *  R = {(1,1), (2,2)} 
      *  R = {(1,1), (2,2), (1,2)}
      *  R = {(1,1), (2,2), (2,1)}
      *  R = {(1,1), (2,2), (1,2), (2,1)} 
   * Total Reflexive Relations = 2^2 = 4

2. **A = {1, 2, 3}**

   * AxA = {(1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3)}
   * Diagonal Elements: (1,1), (2,2), (3,3)
   * Total Reflexive Relations = 2^3 = 8

3. **A = {1, 2, 3, 4}**

   * AxA = {(1,1), (1,2), ... , (4,4)} (16 elements total)
   * Diagonal Elements: (1,1), (2,2), (3,3), (4,4)
   * Total Reflexive Relations = 2^4 = 16

**Generalisation**

* **A = n** (set with 'n' elements)
* **AxA = n^2** (total elements in the Cartesian Product)
* **Diagonal Elements = n**
* **Total Reflexive Relations = 2^ND**
* Total number of non reflexive relations:- 2<sup>n<sup>2</sup></sup>-2<sup>n<sup>2</sup>-n</sup>

smallest size of reflexive relations in set: n
largest size of reflexive relations in set: n<sup>2</sup>


**Calculating Non-Diagonal Elements**

* **ND (Non-Diagonal Elements) = n^2 - n**
* **Simplified: ND = n(n-1)**

**Key Takeaways**

* The number of reflexive relations on a set with 'n' elements is 2^n.
* This is because we have 2 choices for each of the 'n' diagonal elements (include or not include in the relation).
* Non-diagonal elements can be freely added to create different reflexive relations.
