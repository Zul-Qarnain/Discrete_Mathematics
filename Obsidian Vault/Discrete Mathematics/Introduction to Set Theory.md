**Set:** A well unordered collection of distinct elements is called a set.
**Null Set/ Empty Set:** A set with no elements Denoted as Φ , { }


> [!important] Important
> {Φ} This is not a Empty set . It is set which is containing phi

Subset: If every elements of set A is also element of set B then A is the Subset of B
Example:
A={1,2,3,4};B={1,2,3,4} --> A⊆B(A is the subset of B)
C={2,3} --> C⊆A(C is the subset of A) 
==A **trivial set** is one which has the same elements as the main set.== 
==The **maximum number of elements** a set can have to be considered the same as the main set.==


rule:$$
A \leq B
$$
**Proper Subset:** Any subset of A which is not a trivial subset of A is called proper subset of A.(A set which is not equal to main set , in a nutshell it can't be a trivial set.)
example:


A={a,b,c};B={a,b}--> B**⊂**A,B<A(B is the proper set of A).

Cardinality: Total number of elements in a set. A={1,2,4,5}-->cardinality is 4

QS: A⊆B and B⊆A which mean A=B.
